## Exam Guidelines

* The exam consists in a mix of open questions, multiple-choice questions and exercises.
* The exam will be fully on paper, no laptop are needed and neither code writing. Since numerical exercises will be present, don't forget a calculator.
* Personal notes are **not** allowed to be consulted during the exam.
* In the tutoring session before the exam (08/12/2025 08h00), we will see examples of theoretical questions and we will do together the exercises of the [Exercises Guideline](exercises_guideline.pdf).

### Theory

The required knowledge for the theoretical questions can be fully extracted from the slides **and** the notebooks used during the practices. Refer to the above schedule as the required material, no questions will go outside this scope.

### Exercises

In the [Exercises Guideline](exercises_guideline.pdf) you will find examples of exercises that could be present in the exam.
